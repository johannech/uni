The 2nd mandatory assignment in INF2440.

The assignments was to make a program to both generate all prime numbers < N using a method invented by the great mathemacitian

Research used:

- screencast from the course

The course demanded everything to be in a single file while also commenting in Norwegian - which is something I'm not a fond of, but still did.
