The 2nd mandatory assignment in INF2440.

The assignments was to make a program to both generate all prime numbers < N using a method invented by the great mathemacitian Eratosthenes, and then factorize all numbers M < N*N with these prime numbers. This was done both by using multiple threads and by doing it sequentially.

We also had to make a report containing the results of testing the program with N = 2000000 - 2000000000

Research used:

- screencast from the course

The course demanded everything to be in a single file while also commenting in Norwegian - which is something I'm not a fond of, but still did.
